# CIS-Benchmarks-Intune

These are the CIS Microsoft Intune for Windows 10 release 2004 Benchmark, v1.0.1 - 05-18-2021, in JSON format ready to import directly to Intune, each one has been built using the Settings Catalog.

The config profiles are broken down into the individual levels and can be deployed as you see fit.

This is a work in progress, more profiles will be added in time and I will update to newer versions as they are released.

You can import the files using the fantastic Intune Manager tool found here: https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement

Use at your own risk, I always advise you to throughly check the configurations that you are importing to a tenant and test them before production rollout.

Thanks!
